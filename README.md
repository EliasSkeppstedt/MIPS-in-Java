# MIPS
After a digital design course where we created a MIPS in VHDL with support for following instructions; add, addi, and, or, slt, slti, sub, lw, sw, beq, j, and I think that this could be a good task to take on in java to refresh my java knowledge. This will contain classes that act as the porcessor's components, and maybe a state machine to handle the signals sent out by the control unit.
